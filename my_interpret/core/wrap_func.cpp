// We want our library to be loadable into as many Linux distributions as possible.  It seems that on Linux
// the C runtime libraries (libm.so and libc.so) can't be statically linked, or at least it's not advisable
// we therefore want to ensure that we only use older versions of the functions in GLIBC
//
// if we run the command: objdump -T lib_ebmcore_linux_x64.so | grep GLIBC_
// we see the following entry:
// 0000000000000000      DF *UND*  0000000000000000  GLIBC_2.14  memcpy
// the version 2.14 for memcpy has been a problem for some of our users on CentOS
// unfortunately, it seems that this function might be called by the static versions of libgcc OR libstdc++ 
// [verify this] which we're statically linking in (also for compatibility reasons)
// so we need to write our own memcpy.  The easiest thing to do is to call memmove which has the same functionality
// but is safer.  Pretty much all of the places that we call memcpy ourselves, we'd probably benefit by re-writing
// into loops that don't call library functions since we know the exact amount of memory at compile time (thanks to templates)
// so we could straight copy the memory without a loop
//
// we also need to add the following flags to the g++ command (in addition to including this cpp file) : -Wl,--wrap=memcpy
